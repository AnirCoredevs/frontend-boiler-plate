# React Redux Toolkit + Tailwind CSS + Vite Boilerplate

This boilerplate provides a ready-to-use setup for building web applications using React, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. It is designed to help you quickly start a new project with a modern front-end stack that promotes efficient development and scalability.

## Features

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A powerful library that simplifies Redux development by providing utilities like simplified state management, efficient immutable updates, and simplified asynchronous logic handling.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A highly customizable utility-first CSS framework that enables you to rapidly build modern user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast and opinionated build tool that provides instant bundling, hot module replacement (HMR), and an optimized development experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with the boilerplate, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Install dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install
```


## Project Structure

The project structure follows a modular approach that encourages scalability and maintainability. Here's an overview of the key directories and files:

- `src/`: Contains the application source code.
  - `components/`: React components used in the application.
  - `features/`: Redux Toolkit slices, which contain state and logic for specific features of the application.
  - `pages/`: Top-level components that represent the different pages/routes of the application.
  - `store/`: Redux store configuration, including the root reducer and any middleware.
  - `utils/`: Utility functions or helper modules.
  - `assets/`: Image or svg assets.
